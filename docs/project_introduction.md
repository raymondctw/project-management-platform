# Project Management Platform

## Introduction

This project is a web-based project management platform designed to help teams organize, track, and manage projects efficiently. The platform provides tools for creating projects, managing tasks, assigning responsibilities, and monitoring progress.

## Key Features

- **Project Management**: Create, update, and delete projects
- **Task Management**: Create tasks, assign them to team members, and track their status
- **User Management**: Manage team members and their roles
- **Dashboard**: Visualize project progress and team performance
- **API-First Design**: RESTful API built with FastAPI for easy integration

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM (planned for future implementation)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication (planned for future implementation)
- **Frontend**: To be determined (React, Vue, or Angular)
